PIN Java Gradle Templates
------------------------------------
You have just created a basic PIN Java Gradle Project. There is a standard project
structure for source code and tests, connection to PIN Maven/Artifactory Repo, and 
other vanilla things to make a simple project for PIN related hacking.

In this project you get:

* A Gradle build file & Properties File
* This README.md file (you should replace this content with your stuff)
* A .gitignore with some reasonable stuff in it. 
* A standard project structure:

    <proj>
      |
      +- src
          |
          +- main
          |     |
          |     +- java
          |     |
          |     +- resources          
          |
          +- test
          |   |
          |   +- groovy
          |   |
          |   +- java
